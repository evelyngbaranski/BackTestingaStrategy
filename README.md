# BackTestingaStrategy

In these files, I am creating and backtesting my own strategy. The obejctive of the assignment was to practice backtesting and it didn't matter whether the strategy was ultimately effective.

My strategy, however, ended up outperforming when backtested. The strategy was based around buying and selling with changes in interest rates.

CSV files are attached for the interest rates and historical data used.
