# BackTestingaStrategy

In these files, I am creating and backtesting my own strategy. The obejctive of the assignment was to practice backtesting and it didn't matter whether it was correct.

My strategy, however, ended up outperforming when backtested. The strategy was based around buying and selling with changes in interest rates.
